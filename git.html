        <h2>Version Control Systems</h2>
        <p>Version control systems are a category of software tools that helps record changes to files by keeping
            a track of modifications done to the project's source code. <br>Version control enables multiple people to simultaneously 
            work on a single project. Each person edits his/her own copy of files and chooses when to share those changes 
            with the rest of the team.

        <h2>Git and Github</h2>
        <p>
            Git is a distributed version control system form tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files.
            Github is a git repository hosting but it adds many of its own features while git is a command line tool, Github provides a web based graphical interface.

            <h2>Fork</h2>
            <p>
                A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

            <h2>Commit</h2>
            <p>
                The git commit command captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged chages. Commited snapshots can
                be thought of as safe versions of project git will never change them unless you explicitly ask it to.
                Using 'Git Commit' command only saves a new commit object in the local git repository.

            <h2>Push</h2>
            <p>
                The Push command can be considered as a tool to transfer commits between remote repositories and a local one. It is used to publish new local commits on a remote server.
